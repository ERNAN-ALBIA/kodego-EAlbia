            <i>"No man is an Island"</i> a well-known adage that people use to describe how we are all interconnected with one another.
        But the pandemic lockdowns posed a challenge to everyone's sense of community.
        Yet, the pandemic has also been the <u>best time to extend a helping hand to others</u> in the practice of compassion and service in the same way that <i>Saint Loyola</i> did.
        It also taught us to be closer to God through prayers and gave us a new purpose in life.
